# Smart Home Embedded System Project

## Overview

This project is a Smart Home automation system developed as an **Embedded System**. It is designed to provide efficient and modular control of various home appliances using sensors, actuators, and microcontroller-based logic.

## Features

- Modular and layered architecture for easy scalability and maintenance
- Efficient code using optimization techniques and low-level hardware interfacing
- Real-time responsiveness using hardware interrupts
- Control of devices like lights, fans, and temperature sensors
- Safety and reliability through interrupt-driven design

## Project Architecture

This project follows a **Layered Architecture** design pattern to separate responsibilities and promote best development practices.

### 1. MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)

- Direct interaction with hardware registers and peripherals
- Drivers for GPIO, ADC, Timers, UART, and Interrupts
- Ensures portability across microcontrollers

### 2. HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

- Hardware-independent interfaces for peripherals
- Wraps MCAL drivers into reusable modules (e.g., Motor, LED, Relay)
- Simplifies hardware changes without affecting the application layer

### 3. APP (Application Layer)

- Implements smart home logic (e.g., temperature-based fan control)
- Handles user interactions and decision-making
- Integrates and coordinates HAL modules

## Development Best Practices

### ✅ Layered Architecture

- Clear separation between hardware-dependent and hardware-independent code
- Makes the codebase scalable and easier to maintain or port

### ✅ Code Optimization

- Minimal use of polling; reliance on hardware interrupts for real-time response
- Optimization of memory usage and CPU cycles for embedded constraints
- Modular and reusable functions to reduce code duplication

### ✅ Interrupt-Driven Design

- Use of external and internal interrupts for responsive event handling
- Ensures minimal CPU idle time and efficient power consumption
- Improves safety in time-critical operations (e.g., smoke detection)
